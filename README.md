>While Java Developers are familiar with the impact of GC pauses, 
they may not realise that allocating object could be sapping throughput by 10x or 
more the GC cost esp for very short-lived objects.

Throughput, Average Latency <sup>(Across 16 clients, an event is sent in both directions. The Average Latency = 2 * 16 / throughput)</sup>

That is why the AdHoc protocol in Java actively uses value packets. Each packet, the information in the fields which fits into 8 bytes (primitive `long` type), is treated as a value packet. Java has no `value type` similar to the C# `struct`, so the only option is using primitives with annotations.
```java
   static @ValuePack long set(char src, @ValuePack long pack) {return (long)(pack & ~(255  << 32) | ((src) & (~0L))   << 32) ;}
```
